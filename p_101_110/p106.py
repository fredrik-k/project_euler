PROBLEM 106:
Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall
call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets,
 and C, the following properties are true:

S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly
increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained
from a set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested
for equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the
966 subset pairs need to be tested.

For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained
need to be tested for equality?

NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 105.
